"""Assemble a Hugging Face model directory from a tt-tnt checkpoint.

Everything about the architecture comes from the **checkpoint header**. Plan 3 enriched
that header precisely so this step never guesses: ``intermediate_dim``, ``weight_tying``,
and ``rms_norm_eps`` exist only as ttml C++ defaults and are recoverable from nothing else.
A missing field raises rather than defaulting — a quiet default is how a converted model
silently mismatches the weights it ships with.

No ttnn, no ttml: the checkpoint is plain pickle + numpy.
