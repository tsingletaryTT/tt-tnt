"""Checkpoint header schema and thin wrappers over ``ttml.checkpointing``.

ttml already does the hard part — it streams tensors to disk one at a time and writes
atomically (temp file then rename), so a crash mid-write leaves the previous checkpoint
intact. We add two things it deliberately leaves open:

1. **A validated header schema.** ttml's header is an opaque dict, so nothing checks it. A
   checkpoint whose header omits ``vocab_size`` cannot be converted later without guessing,
   and guessing is how a converted model silently mismatches its tokenizer.
2. **Path conventions**, so checkpoints sort by step and a resume can find the newest.

Everything else is a pass-through. Do not reimplement ttml's storage.

    ``vocab_size`` is recorded from ``train.config`` rather than passed in: it must
    describe the model that produced these weights, and taking it from the single source
    of truth removes the chance of a caller recording something else.

    ``seq_len`` records the sequence length **actually used to train this checkpoint**.
    It defaults to ``train.config.SEQ_LEN`` purely for callers (tests, ad-hoc scripts)
    that don't care and don't want to plumb it explicitly — but ``seq_len`` is now a CLI
    flag (``train/run.py --seq-len``), so the module constant is no longer necessarily
    what any given run actually used. The real training call site always passes
    ``seq_len=cfg.seq_len`` explicitly (the resolved ``RunConfig`` value for *this* run),
    precisely so a header never silently records a value the run didn't use. Recording the
    wrong seq_len here would propagate into ``convert/to_hf.py``'s
    ``max_position_embeddings`` with no error anywhere along the way — exactly the kind of
    silent lie this schema exists to prevent for the other fields.

    ``step`` and ``seq_len`` (already in the header) let us record the number that actually
    matters, ``tokens_seen``, without the caller having to compute or pass it separately.

    context at all (ttml not importable, no device, an API that moved) is reported as a reason,

    Why DDP-only is exactly the right question to ask. Under data parallelism the model is
    **replicated** and only the batch is sharded — no parameter is ever legitimately split, so
    a ``Shard`` placement on one is necessarily the metadata defect described in

    model. ttml's own gradient reduction draws the same distinction from the same fact —
    ``core/distributed/distributed.cpp``'s ``is_sharded_on_axis`` treats a ``Shard`` placement
    as "FSDP already reduce-scattered this", i.e. as meaningful only when a
    parameter-sharding parallelism is switched on.

    chip holds the whole of every parameter. But the tensor's *topology metadata* does not stay
    replicated. Probed directly on a ``[1, 4]`` mesh:

    ===========================  ==========================  ====================

    ``ttml.checkpointing.save_checkpoint`` then does exactly what that metadata tells it to —
    ``Sharding.from_tensor(t).gather(t)`` concatenates the four "shards" — and writes a
    checkpoint in which every tensor carries four copies stacked on dim 0, with an extra
    leading dimension that ``convert/checkpoint_reader.py``, ``convert/hf_mapping.py`` and
    ``convert/ttml_forward.py`` (all of which assume whole ``[1, 1, out, in]`` tensors) cannot
    read. Measured: 1,475,602,288 bytes against 737,824,624 for the identical ``--ddp 1`` run.

    WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THIS IS NOW A NARROWED GATE RATHER THAN A BLANKET ONE.
    ``ttnn.Tensor.update_tensor_topology`` is bound in Python (``pytensor.cpp:1611``) and
    ``ttnn.TensorTopology`` is constructible from Python (``distributed_nanobind.cpp:734``), so
    the false metadata can be corrected in this repo, at save time, without touching a byte of
    weight data — see :func:`replicated_for_save`. This function's job is therefore no longer
    "refuse whenever anything is sharded" but the sharper question **"is this sharding
    explainable?"**:

    * ttml's live parallelism context must be **DDP and only DDP**
      (:func:`_ddp_only_parallelism`). Under DDP the model is replicated and only the batch is
      split, so no parameter can legitimately be sharded. Under TP one genuinely can be, and
      the answer is still to refuse.
    * every offending tensor must be distributed over **exactly the DDP axis**
      (:func:`_ddp_axis_topologies`) — distribution shape ``[ddp_size]`` over ``ddp_size``
      coordinates, nothing wider and nothing two-dimensional.

    Both conditions fail closed. If a future parallelism really does shard parameters, the
    first condition alone stops it, and the refusal below is what an operator sees.

    Single-chip runs never reach the offender branch at all: with no mesh,
    ``Sharding.from_tensor`` reports no topology and ``is_fully_replicated`` is ``True`` by
    definition.

    Yields the number of tensors re-marked. Every tensor recorded as sharded — having already
    passed :func:`assert_saveable_on_mesh`, so the sharding is known to be the data-parallel
    re-mark and nothing else — has its topology replaced by an otherwise identical one whose
    placements are all ``Replicate``. ``ttml.checkpointing.save_checkpoint`` then reads that
    topology (``Sharding.from_tensor(t).gather(t)``) and takes a **single copy** of each
    tensor, which is what the ``--ddp 1`` path writes and what ``convert/`` expects.

    WHY THIS APPROACH AND NOT THE OTHER TWO. Three ways to make ``--ddp N`` write a correct
    checkpoint were available:

    (a) *this one* — correct the false metadata, save, restore. It moves **no data at all**:
        ``update_tensor_topology`` rewrites the ``TensorTopology`` on the tensor's shared
        ``TensorAttributes`` (``tensor.cpp:389``) and nothing else. The save then costs exactly
        what a ``--ddp 1`` save costs, because the composer takes one copy instead of four.
    (b) *extract one replica and write it ourselves* — would mean reimplementing ttml's
        streaming, atomic (temp-file-then-rename) storage, which this module's own docstring
        forbids for good reason, and would put a second checkpoint writer in the tree that
        could drift from the one every other path uses.
    (c) *assign a freshly-replicated tensor back into each parameter* — reads every parameter
        to host and writes it back to four devices, i.e. maximum data movement, and it mutates
        the live model rather than a piece of metadata about it.

    THE RESTORE IS NOT OPTIONAL, and not because ``Replicate`` would be wrong — it is in fact
    the truthful marking. It is because a checkpoint save happens *mid-run*
    (``--save-every``), and a save that leaves the training state different from how it found
    it is a save that can change the run's result. Restoring the original topology object makes
    that impossible to argue about: after ``save()`` returns, every tensor carries the exact
    topology it carried before, so a run with ``--save-every`` and a run without it are the
    same computation. (Measured: training continues normally through a re-mark/restore cycle.)

    A NOTE ON WHICH REPLICA IS WRITTEN, because it is not always a distinction without a
    difference. With ``stochastic_rounding: false`` the four replicas are bit-identical (max
    ``|replica0 - replica_i| = 0.0`` over all 66 tensors, 4 steps) and "one copy" is
    unambiguous. With ``stochastic_rounding: true`` — which is what
    ``train/configs/nanollama3_bpe_v2.yaml`` selects, and what this project's real runs use —
    each device rounds its own AdamW update independently, so the replicas perform independent
    random walks and **do** differ (measured 2.34e-2 on ``llama_block_5/mlp_norm/gamma`` after
    4 steps). What gets written is replica 0. That is a complete and coherent model — replica 0
    saw every all-reduced gradient and applied every update — but it is one of four, not the
    only one. See ``.superpowers/ddp-checkpoint-fix.md`` and upstream ask 4.

    """Write an ``SFTTrainer`` checkpoint, reading each parameter at NATIVE precision.

    Pass as ``SFTTrainer(..., checkpoint_saver=save_sft_checkpoint)``. The signature is
    the hook's: ``(trainer, path)``.

    **Why this exists.** ``SFTTrainer._save_checkpoint``'s default saver reads every
    parameter with ``tensor.to_numpy(ttnn.DataType.FLOAT32, composer=...)`` and passes no
    ``precision=``, so it takes the binding's default, ``PreferredPrecision::FULL``. Our
    parameters are bfloat16, so ``AutocastTensor`` stores them in its half-precision slot
    and leaves the full-precision slot empty (``autograd/autocast_tensor.cpp``
    ``set_tensor``). AdamW then mutates the bf16 tensor **in place** and never calls
    ``set_tensor``, so nothing invalidates anything. The first FULL read typecasts
    bf16 -> fp32 and *caches* the result in ``m_full_precision_tensor``; every later FULL
    read finds ``has_full()`` true and is handed that same cached array back. tt-metal
    documents the hazard in that file:

        TODO: Lazy precision caching can leave the FULL/FLOAT32 view stale after
        in-place updates that mutate only the BF16 tensor (e.g. optimizer step).
        Tracking: #41657

    Measured consequence, before this fix: ``artifacts/checkpoints-1024-tool-calling``'s
    ``step_1000.pkl`` and ``step_3000.pkl`` are identical in **all 66 tensors** (max abs
    diff 0.0) — the step-1000 weights, written three times. Only the ``step`` field
    differs, so the files' checksums differ and nothing looked wrong. The pretrain path
    is unaffected (0/50 identical over the same span) because ``ttml.checkpointing``
    already reads NATIVE.

    ``ttml.sharding.Sharding.gather`` is that NATIVE read, and is what ttml's own
    checkpointing uses — we call it rather than reimplementing the precision handling.
    It returns the tensor in its stored dtype; the ``{"step", "model_state"}`` format
    ``scripts/eval_improv.sft_checkpoint_to_hf`` consumes wants float32, so the cast to
    float32 happens here, on the host, after the value has been read.

    Sharded parameters are refused rather than gathered. Under DDP a parameter is
    (falsely) marked ``Shard(0)`` while its data is genuinely replicated — see
    :func:`replicated_for_save` — and gathering one would concatenate every replica into
    a single oversized tensor. That is a different defect with a different fix, and this
    saver has never been exercised against it, so it fails loudly instead.
