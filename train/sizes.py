"""The model-size registry — one entry per architecture this repository ships.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Until this module, the architecture came from ``$TT_METAL_HOME/tt-train/configs/
model_configs/nanollama3.yaml``: a file we did not own, could not vary, and which could
change under a tt-metal upgrade without any signal. That made a second model size
impossible and made the first one fragile.

Now every architecture lives in ``train/configs/model/`` and is described here. The YAML
remains the file ttml actually reads; this registry is the *typed* description of it, plus
the derived hardware facts that YAML cannot express. ``tests/test_sizes.py`` asserts the
two never drift apart.

WHAT THE DERIVED PROPERTIES ARE FOR
-----------------------------------
Choosing ``embedding_dim`` and ``num_groups`` for a Tenstorrent model is not a free choice
the way it is on a GPU — both decide, at design time, how much of the die the model can
use and which meshes it can be served on. Those consequences were discovered the expensive
way on the 384 model (see ``docs/multi-chip-notes.md`` and the 384 YAML's header) and are
encoded here so the next size is chosen with the numbers visible rather than by convention:

- ``tiles`` / ``best_core_grid`` / ``core_utilisation`` — how much of the compute grid a
  tensor of this width can actually occupy.
- ``servable_mesh_widths`` — which mesh shapes ``tt_transformers`` will accept, from its
  ``n_heads % cluster_shape[1] == 0 and n_kv_heads % cluster_shape[1] == 0`` assertion
  (``models/tt_transformers/tt/model_config.py:687-691``).
- ``tensor_parallel_capable`` — whether the hidden dimension splits into whole 32-wide
  tiles per chip.

Nothing here talks to hardware; it is pure arithmetic over the config, so it is testable
without a device.
