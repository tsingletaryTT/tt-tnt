"""Skits: five-turn improv scenes derived deterministically from single corpus stories.

WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN REUSING train.improv's single-turn derivation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stage 1 gave the model a think-block before one continuation. Two of the five slots could
not be scored at all in that shape:

  * `handback` encodes "make your partner look good" and there was no partner, so the slot
    was decorative by construction and no scorer could have rescued it.
  * `stakes` was measured as an intensity delta INSIDE one continuation. Escalation in
    improv happens ACROSS an exchange, so that measured the wrong interval.

A skit has a later turn, so every slot becomes a falsifiable prediction about text that did
not exist when the prediction was made. That is the whole point, and it is what stage 1
structurally could not ask.

SHAPE
    prefix    sentences[0:2]   context only, never supervised
    turn 0    sentences[2]     MODEL   <- think-block 0
    turn 1    sentences[3]     PARTNER real corpus text
    turn 2    sentences[4]     MODEL   <- think-block 1
    turn 3    sentences[5]     PARTNER real corpus text
    turn 4    sentences[6]     MODEL   <- think-block 2

Measured on 2,000 stories: 99.8% have >= 7 sentences, and a five-turn skit is median 202 /
p99 257 / max 327 tokens, so 100% fit the 512 window even after tile alignment. The window
is not a constraint here.

KNOWN LIMITATION: split_sentences (in train.improv) over-splits dialogue with attribution.
A sentence like '"It says!" said Person.' splits into two sentences: the quote and the
dialogue tag separately. This causes some skits to drop when a model turn fails to carry
any words from a partner turn that ended with dialogue. This is deliberate: the limitation
exists in published stage-1 results and fixing the splitter would break reproducibility of
those measurements. Skit derivation will show measurably higher drop rates on stories with
dialogue-ending turns until the splitter is fixed as a standalone change with re-publication
of stage-1 provenance.

    `offer_text` is the IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING span — the partner's turn for blocks 1 and 2,
    or, for block 0, the WHOLE two-sentence prefix (there is no partner turn yet). That is
    what makes `accept` mean accepting an offer rather than merely repeating a word from
    somewhere in the scene.

    NOTE on block 0: the design spec (2026-08-21-skits-design.md) says "the prefix's final
    sentence" here. The code uses both prefix sentences and always has; the spec sentence is
    an erratum, not a description of behaviour. The published stage-2 measurement rests on
    the two-sentence form, so the code is authoritative and the spec is corrected to match.
    `test_offer_of_block_0_is_the_whole_prefix_not_its_last_sentence` pins this.

    `established` is every content word in the scene so far, which is what `add` is measured
    against: a word already in play is not an addition even if this particular turn is the
