"""Train tt-tnt on Tenstorrent hardware.

We own this entrypoint because tt-train's own Python trainer does not work against the
current tree: ``examples/python/transformers/training.py`` imports a ``trainer`` module
that is not on its path, calls ``train()`` with an extra ``val_ids`` argument the signature
does not accept, and relies on a ``TrainingConfig`` that lacks the ``seq_len`` ``train()``
requires. Its data loader also hardcodes ``$TT_METAL_HOME/tt-train/data/shakespeare.txt``.

What we reuse from ttml (never reimplemented): both of its Llama implementations,
``create_optimizer``, ``initialize_device``, ``set_seed``, and the ``train()`` loop itself.
What we supply: our corpus, our tokenizer, ``seq_len``, and a **real** validation loss —
ttml's ``train()`` fills ``val_losses`` with a copy of the training loss under a comment
calling it placeholder behavior, so a val number from it means nothing.

*Which* Llama is chosen by ``--model-impl``. The default (``python``) is ttml's Python
``Llama`` wrapped by ``train.model``, which drops the redundant causal mask and so runs SDPA
on its causal path — 1.41x faster per step at ``--size 384``, 1.15x at ``--size 1024``.
``cpp`` is ttml's ``TransformerModelFactory``/``CppLlama``, what this entrypoint used before
2026-08-16, kept as an A/B lever. Checkpoints from the two are interchangeable; see
``train/model.py`` for why the two exist and what the wrapper has to reconcile.

ttml's ``train()`` has no checkpoint hook of its own, so periodic checkpointing is done by
calling it repeatedly in chunks of ``--save-every`` steps and saving between chunks (see
``train.checkpoint``); the optimizer object persists across those calls, so AdamW's moments
carry over rather than resetting each chunk. ``--resume latest`` (or a specific checkpoint
path) restores model and optimizer state before training resumes — note that ``--steps`` in
a ``--resume`` run counts steps to run *from* the checkpoint, not an absolute target step;
see ``--resume``'s help below. ``--checkpoint-dir`` selects where checkpoints are read from
and written to.

The same chunk loop also drives periodic validation (``--val-every``): since we already stop
between chunks to checkpoint, evaluating there too is nearly free and produces a loss curve
instead of one number at the end of a long run — see ``run_training_loop`` and ``evaluate()``.
It is independent of ``--save-every``: the two boundaries need not coincide.

    TWO SEPARATE THINGS GO WRONG WITHOUT THIS, and only the first was anticipated.

    **1. There is no descriptor at all for 4 devices.**
    ``ttml.core.distributed.enable_fabric`` ships defaults for **8 and 32 devices only**
    (``ttnn_fixed/distributed/tt_metal.cpp:80-88``); any other count returns ``std::nullopt``
    and falls back to a bare ``FABRIC_2D``. Measured on this box, that hangs before the mesh
    even opens — killed at 600s with no output at all.

    **2. The descriptor's declared shape must MATCH THE LOGICAL MESH, not the cabling.**
    This is the part that cost the most to find, because it fails silently. tt-metal's
    ``p300_x2_mesh_graph_descriptor.textproto`` declares ``device_topology { dims: [2, 2] }``,
    which correctly describes a TT-QuietBox 2 (two dual-chip p300 cards, four Blackhole chips
    in a 2x2 ring). Pointing at it makes the ``[1, 4]`` mesh **open successfully** and the
    model train at full speed — and then the run stops dead the first time a gradient
    all-reduce crosses the mesh axis. It is not an error, a warning, or a diagnosable
    mismatch; it is a hang. Supplying a descriptor that declares ``[1, 4]`` instead — the
    logical shape ``--ddp 4`` opens — makes the identical run work, with every replica's
    parameters bit-identical afterwards.

    So the descriptors are vendored under ``train/configs/mesh/`` rather than selected from
    tt-metal's directory: the file this project needs is chosen by the mesh *it* opens, and
    no shipped descriptor names that shape. See ``.superpowers/ddp-bringup.md`` for the full
    experiment, including the no-sync control that proves the difference is real.

    An operator who has already exported ``TT_MESH_GRAPH_DESC_PATH`` keeps their value: this
    returns ``None`` in that case so the caller leaves the environment alone. ``devices <= 1``
    also returns ``None`` — a single-chip run arms no fabric and needs no descriptor, which
    is why every measurement recorded before 2026-08-16 never met this.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if ``devices`` has no vendored descriptor. Better than falling back to a
            shape that hangs.

    So a run that opens a ``[1, 4]`` mesh and passes ``use_ddp=True`` to ``train()`` — which
    is otherwise a complete-looking DDP setup — but never reaches this function gets **four

    Nothing upstream will tell us if this goes wrong, so the post-conditions are checked here
    and a mismatch is raised rather than logged. ``ParallelismContext``'s constructor assigns
    the DDP axis by *inspecting the open mesh*
    (``autograd/auto_context.cpp:157-218``) rather than taking it as an argument, so
    ``get_ddp_size()`` is a genuine read-back of what the hardware mesh turned out to be, not
    an echo of the ``ddp`` we passed in. Asserting it equals ``ddp`` therefore catches an
    opened mesh that is not the mesh we asked for, as well as a context that failed to
    register DDP at all.

    Called only when ``ddp > 1``: on a unit mesh there is no axis to reduce over, and

    """Real validation loss over ``batches`` sampled windows.

    ttml's train() does not compute this — it appends the last training loss and labels it
    val_loss. We run the model in eval mode over held-out tokens and average properly.

    ``model.eval()`` only toggles dropout (0.0 in this config) — it does not disable
    gradient tracking. Without ``no_grad()``, every forward pass here would still build a
    full autograd graph that gets thrown away, wasting memory and compute and OOMing first
    at larger ``validation_batch_size``. ``no_grad`` also lives in ``ttml.common.utils``,
    alongside ``build_causal_mask``, so one import covers both.

    UNDER DDP (``use_ddp=True``) two things change, and both are required rather than
    optional:

    1. The validation batch is sharded across the mesh, exactly as the training batch is —
       ``get_batch_ttml``'s own ``use_ddp`` argument (``ttml/common/trainer.py:30-38``)
       selects ``shard_tensor_to_mesh_mapper(device, 0)``. Without it the host array is
       *replicated*, so every chip evaluates the same ``validation_batch_size`` windows and
       the "held-out sample" is a quarter the size it claims to be.
    2. ``loss.to_numpy()`` needs a composer. The loss is one scalar **per device**, i.e. a
       tensor distributed over the mesh, and reading it back without a composer raises
       ``Can't get a single buffer from host storage distributed over mesh``. Composing on
       dim 0 concatenates the four per-device scalars, and ``.mean()`` over them is the mean
       over the whole (sharded) batch because every shard has the same number of rows.

    Neither the mask nor the model needs mesh handling: DDP *replicates* weights, and a
    ``from_numpy`` with no mapper on a mesh device replicates too — which is exactly what
    ``ttml.common.trainer.train()`` relies on for its own causal mask.

    """The learning rate a ``schedule`` prescribes at ``step`` of a ``total_steps`` run.

    Pure arithmetic — no optimizer, no device, no state. That is deliberate: it makes the
    whole schedule testable on a machine with no board (``tests/test_lr_schedule.py``), and
    it means the LR is a function of *position in the run* rather than of how many times
    something happened to be stepped. The latter matters here specifically, because the
    caller advances in **non-uniform chunks** (see ``run_training_loop``) and a step-counting
    scheduler object would silently mis-time itself on the short final chunk.

    WHY NOT REUSE ttml's SCHEDULERS. tt-train ships
    ``~/tt-metal/tt-train/sources/ttml/ttml/common/schedulers.py`` (``CosineAnnealing``,
    ``Step``, ``Linear``, ``Lambda``, ``Sequential``). They were the first thing checked and
    they do not fit this loop. Every one of them is a stateful object whose ``step()``
    advances an internal counter by exactly one and then calls ``optimizer.set_lr()`` —
    they are built for a loop that owns each individual training step. We do not own the
    individual steps: ttml's ``train()`` is a black box that runs ``cfg.steps`` steps
    internally and exposes no per-step hook (verified — ``ttml/common/trainer.py`` has no
    scheduler or LR callback of any kind). So the only place we can move the LR is *between*
    chunks, and those chunks are 500 steps here but 264 for the run's remainder. Driving a
    counter-based scheduler from that would either need one ``step()`` call per training step
    (500 redundant C++ ``set_lr`` calls per chunk, purely to advance a counter) or would let
    the counter drift out of correspondence with the real step number. A position function is
    both simpler and exactly right.

    THE SHAPE. ``decay_start_frac`` holds the LR flat at ``base_lr`` for that fraction of the
    run, then decays to ``min_lr`` across whatever is left. ``0.0`` (the default) decays over
    the whole run — the plain reading of "a cosine schedule". A non-zero value is the
    stable-then-decay ("decay tail") shape, which is what makes a clean A/B against an
    existing constant-LR run possible: the held portion reproduces that run exactly, so any
    divergence is attributable to the decay alone.

    ``constant`` ignores ``min_lr``/``decay_start_frac`` entirely and returns ``base_lr``.

    Args:
        base_lr: The peak/held LR — the optimizer's configured LR, unchanged from the config.
        step: Position in the run, in steps. Fractional positions are meaningful and
            expected — ``run_training_loop`` passes chunk *midpoints*. Clamped to
            ``[0, total_steps]``.
        total_steps: Length of the run the schedule spans. ``<= 0`` yields ``base_lr``.
        schedule: One of :data:`LR_SCHEDULES`.
        min_lr: LR at the end of the decay. Never returned before the run's final step.
        warmup_frac: Fraction of the run spent ramping linearly from 0 to ``base_lr``
            before anything else happens. 0 (the default) disables warmup entirely, so
            every pre-existing call site is unchanged. Applies to ``constant`` too.
        decay_start_frac: Fraction of the run held at ``base_lr`` before decay begins, in
            ``[0.0, 1.0]``. ``>= 1.0`` means "never decay" and yields ``base_lr`` throughout.

    Mutates ``cfg.steps`` on every sub-chunk, same contract the pre-refactor loop in
    ``main()`` had (``train_fn`` reads ``cfg.steps`` to know how far to run).

    ``lr_fn``, when given, is the learning-rate schedule (in production a partial of
    :func:`lr_at_step`). It maps a position in the run, in steps, to a learning rate, and is
    applied by calling ``optimizer.set_lr()`` **once per chunk, before that chunk runs** —
    the only place the LR can be moved at all, since ttml's ``train()`` runs a whole chunk
    internally with no per-step hook. The position handed to ``lr_fn`` is the chunk's
    **midpoint** (``ran + cfg.steps / 2``), not its start or end: the LR is necessarily held
    constant across the chunk, and evaluating at the midpoint makes that staircase an
    unbiased approximation of the continuous schedule instead of one that lags (chunk start)
    or leads (chunk end) it by a chunk. When ``lr_fn`` is ``None`` — the default, and what
    ``--lr-schedule constant`` resolves to — ``set_lr`` is never called at all, so the
    optimizer keeps exactly the LR its config gave it and this loop is bit-identical to its
    pre-schedule behaviour. That is why the default is ``None`` rather than a
    constant-returning function: every run recorded before schedules existed stays
    reproducible, and the optimizer is not touched by a feature that isn't in use.

    ``use_ddp`` is forwarded verbatim to both ``train_fn`` and ``evaluate_fn``. It is a
    single flag rather than two because they must never disagree: ``train_fn`` reads it to
    decide whether to shard the batch **and whether to call ``synchronize_gradients``**
    (``ttml/common/trainer.py``), and ``evaluate_fn`` reads it to decide whether to shard the
    validation batch and compose the loss back. Passing it to one and not the other produces
    either a crash (uncomposed loss on a mesh) or a quietly wrong number (a validation set a
    quarter the intended size), depending on which way round the mistake goes. The caller in
    ``main()`` derives it from a single ``--ddp`` value, so there is one source of truth.

    Returns ``(all_losses, val_records)``. ``val_records`` is also the list appended, one
    JSON object per line, to ``val_log_path`` (skipped if ``val_log_path`` is ``None``) —
    each record is ``{"step": absolute_step, "train_loss": ..., "val_loss": ...}``, where
    ``val_loss`` comes from a real call to ``evaluate_fn`` (never copied from
    ``train_loss`` — that copy is exactly the ttml placeholder behaviour this module exists
    to avoid, see the module docstring). When ``lr_fn`` is given, each record carries an
    extra ``"lr"`` field recording the rate actually in effect over the chunk that just ran,
    so the curve says what it was trained at. The field is omitted entirely under the default
    constant behaviour, keeping those logs identical in shape to every previously-recorded run.

    These are not in any yaml (``nanollama3.yaml`` never sets them) and — apart from
    ``intermediate_dim`` — are not recoverable from the checkpoint's own tensors either,
    so they must be captured at write time or a later converter has to guess.
    ``weight_tying`` is the dangerous one: because it is on, a checkpoint has no
    ``llama/tok_emb/weight`` tensor at all (the embedding is tied to ``llama/fc/weight``),
    and a converter that doesn't know produces a model with a randomly-initialized
    embedding table while raising no error.

    **Why this is a function and not a dict literal at the call site.** It used to be a
    literal, with ``"intermediate_dim": 1024`` written out by hand. 1024 is the value
    ttml *derives* for the 384 model, so the constant was invisibly correct for the only
    size that had ever been trained — and silently wrong for the first ``--size 1024``
    run, which built a 2816-wide FFN while its checkpoints claimed 1024. Training did not
    care (ttml derives the width itself and never reads the header), but
    ``convert/to_hf.py`` copies the field straight into ``config.json``'s
    ``intermediate_size``, so the converted model failed to load at all. Deriving it from
    the size registry — the module that already reproduces ttml's rule and is pinned
    against the real converted model by ``tests/test_sizes.py`` — makes that class of
