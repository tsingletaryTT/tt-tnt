"""Self-consistency gates for the v4 manifests in ``manifests/``.

WHY THESE EXIST
---------------
tt-kernel validates a manifest's *shape* — types, required fields, PEP 440 ranges — but not
its *coherence*. Several ways of writing a manifest that parses cleanly will serve the
wrong thing, silently:

- ``mesh.devices: 4`` with ``env.MESH_DEVICE`` naming a single-chip preset. These are two
  independent channels: the whole ``mesh`` block contributes **nothing** to the rendered
  ``vllm_metadata.json`` (verified: it has exactly four keys — ``arch``, ``hf_weights``,
  ``launch``, ``main_class``), and the mesh shape the plugin actually opens comes only from
  the ``MESH_DEVICE`` string. Nothing cross-checks them, so a bundle can advertise four
  chips and serve on one.
- ``resources.max_model_len`` disagreeing with the architecture's trained context. The
  tokenizer advertises ``model_max_length: 1000000000000000019884624838656``, so anything
  deriving a context from it gets a serving stack accepting 4k prompts from a model trained
  to 256 — degraded output, no error.
- An architecture whose ``num_groups`` cannot shard onto the mesh the manifest claims, which
  fails at ``model_config.py:687-691`` only once a device is open.

Each is caught here, against the size registry, with no hardware and no Hub access.

#: The context each manifest's *actually-published* weights were trained to, independent of
#: ``train/sizes.py``'s ``max_sequence_length``.
#:
#: Before 2026-08-13 these two numbers were always the same value, because
#: ``ModelSize.max_sequence_length`` had only one meaning: "what this architecture was
#: trained to." Raising ``seq_len`` to 512 for the next training run (see
#: ``.superpowers/seqlen-ddp-investigation.md``) gave it a second, forward-looking meaning
#: -- "what the vendored YAML currently targets for the NEXT run of this architecture" --
#: and for a day those two meanings legitimately disagreed for ``384``, so this constant
#: held 256 against a registry that already said 512.
#:
#: **That gap closed for 384 at 512, and has now closed again at 2048.** The size registry
#: moved ``384`` to ``max_sequence_length=2048``, and ``episod/tt-tnt`` was retrained at
#: that context as tt-tnt-v3 (``artifacts/checkpoints-tt-tnt-v3``, 10,764 steps, final
#: val_loss 2.939, against v1's 4.31 on a differently-composed val split) and republished.
#: Verified directly rather than taken on trust:
#: ``artifacts/hf-tt-tnt-v3/config.json`` reads ``max_position_embeddings: 2048``, and its
#: ``model.safetensors`` (sha256 ``97e19118...``) is what was uploaded -- distinct from
#: v1's ``dbc46211...``. The manifest that serves those weights must therefore declare
#: 2048, or serving silently truncates three quarters of the model's trained context --
#: the same trap this test exists to catch, from the other direction, and a bigger bite of
#: it than the 512 case was.
#:
#: ``1024`` went to 2048 on 2026-08-29 and came BACK to 512 the same day. The 2048 publish
#: was real (it happened, and is in this file's git history), and was reverted because the
#: 2048-context weights answered questions measurably worse than the 512 checkpoint they
#: replaced, while the serving crash that motivated the raise turned out to be fixed by the
#: chat-template windowing guard alone -- verified at 512 context, 14 growing turns, zero
#: crashes. See CLAUDE.md's 2026-08-29 entry and ``train/configs/model/tt-tnt-1024.yaml``.
#:
#: This constant is therefore back to 512, which is what ``episod/tt-tnt-1024`` actually
#: serves again. That round trip is itself the argument for this constant existing: it
#: tracks the PUBLISHED artifact, so it moved twice in one day without either value ever
#: having been wrong at the time it was set.
#:
#: Update a *published* entry here only once that size's weights are ACTUALLY retrained and
#: republished at the new context length -- not when the registry's design target changes.
