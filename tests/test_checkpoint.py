# The SFT saver: reading a bf16 parameter without precision=NATIVE reads a cache
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Added 2026-08-31. Every SFT run this project has done (skits, improv, editor,
# tool-calling) wrote the SAME weights to every `step_*.pkl`: measured directly,
# step_1000.pkl and step_3000.pkl of artifacts/checkpoints-1024-tool-calling are
# identical in all 66 tensors (max abs diff 0.0), while the pretrain path's own
# checkpoints differ in 50/50. Only the `step` field differs, which is why the
# files' md5s differ and the duplication went unnoticed.
#
# Root cause is tt-metal's own documented TODO in
# tt-train/sources/ttml/autograd/autocast_tensor.cpp:
#
#     TODO: Lazy precision caching can leave the FULL/FLOAT32 view stale
#     after in-place updates that mutate only the BF16 tensor (e.g. optimizer
#     step).  Tracking: #41657
#
# Our parameters are bf16, so AutocastTensor holds them in the half slot and
# leaves the full slot empty. AdamW mutates the bf16 tensor in place and never
# calls set_tensor(), so nothing invalidates. SFTTrainer._save_checkpoint reads
# `tensor.to_numpy(FLOAT32, composer=...)` with no `precision=`, which defaults
# to FULL: the first save typecasts bf16 -> fp32 and CACHES it, and every later
# save is handed that cache back. ttml's every other serialization site already
# reads NATIVE for exactly this reason (checkpointing.py:38, sharding.py:78,90).

    therefore incapable of observing any training that happened after its first save.
