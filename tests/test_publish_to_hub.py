"""scripts/publish_to_hub.py: exercises everything that doesn't require the network.

Hub-dependent behavior (repo creation, upload, the --verify round trip) is covered by
running the script for real and reporting its output, per the packaging plan's rule that
Hub-dependent verification may be a script rather than a test. What *is* tested here, with
no network access, is the safety-load-bearing part: dry-run never reaches the Hub, writes
require --yes, the file listing matches the real artifact, and the card-loading fix for the
leading-HTML-comment gotcha actually parses front matter (rather than the silent-empty-card
failure mode this suite exists to catch).
