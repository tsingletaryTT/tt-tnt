"""Does ttml's SFTTrainer train OUR model with a loss mask? Eight hand-made examples.

Front-loaded deliberately (Task 2 of the improv-thinking plan). Every later task assumes
this path works, and this repo has only ever trained through train/run.py --
ttml.trainers.SFTTrainer is an unexercised code path here. Failing here changes the plan,
not the code: the fallback (full-sequence loss, no masking) is a design decision, not a
workaround this script should reach for.

TILE ALIGNMENT (added after the first run of this script found a real blocker): the
first attempt crashed in loss.backward() with a TT_FATAL from ttml's SDPA backward kernel
("u_scaler shape mismatch") whenever the collated batch's sequence length T was not a
multiple of 32 (ttml's tile width) -- see task-2-report.md for the full trace and the
diagnostic that isolated this. The coordinator's ruling: fix it in the example builder,
not in a custom collate, so sft_collate_fn and everything downstream in ttml stay
untouched. This script now builds its 8 examples through
scripts.derive_traces.build_sft_examples, the same tile-aligning builder Task 5 will use,
so this smoke test exercises the actual production path rather than a hand-rolled one
that could silently drift from it.

Constructor substitution (see Step 3 in the plan / task brief): the plan's expected entry
point, ``ttml.models.llama.create_llama_from_config``, does not exist in the installed
ttml (verified: ``dir(ttml.models.llama)`` has no such name -- it has ``Llama``,
``LlamaConfig``, ``create_cpp_llama_model``, but no ``create_llama_from_config``). This
repo's own train/run.py builds its Llama via ``train.model.create_model(yaml_config,
transformer_config)`` (see train/model.py's module docstring and its ``create_model``
function) precisely because that wrapper's ``TtTntLlama`` accepts a null attention mask on
the causal path, same requirement SFTTrainer has (``attention_mask=None`` lets the model
build a causal mask on its own). That is the substitution used below.

WARM-START LOSS GUARD (added after Task 5 found what this smoke test's random-init
version could not catch): a smoke test that trains 4 steps from FRESH random weights
cannot tell a correct label convention from a wrong one -- both look like "high loss,
went down a bit" against a randomly initialised model. Task 5 shipped a full plan with
`scripts/derive_traces.py`'s labels in the wrong convention (same-position/HF-style
instead of ttml's pre-shifted `labels[t] == input_ids[t+1]`) for exactly this reason: it
trained from random weights here, then warm-started for real training, and only the
warm-started run's absolute loss (~11, not ~1.7-2.9) exposed the bug -- three tasks and
one full training run later than it should have (see task-5-report.md's addendum for the
full trail). This script now warm-starts from the same production checkpoint Task 5
trains from and asserts the FIRST step's loss is below a threshold chosen to sit
comfortably between "correct" (~1.7-2.9, this checkpoint's own validation range) and
"broken" (~11.5, what the label-shift bug produced) -- a random-init smoke could never
draw this line, because both outcomes start from the same place.
