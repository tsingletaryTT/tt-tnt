"""Stage-1 evaluation: the swap test FIRST, then schema adherence and failure rates.

THE SWAP TEST RUNS FIRST ON PURPOSE. If substituting another story's think-block barely
changes the continuation, the model learned to emit a plan and ignore it -- the thinking is
decorative and stage 1 has failed, regardless of how good the other numbers look. This
control exists because die-region gate seeding once worked as a classifier (61.2% against
10% chance) and bought nothing measurable in loss. Skill at producing an artefact is not
evidence the artefact is used.

CONTROLLER RULING -- OVERRIDES THE ORIGINAL TASK-6 BRIEF'S `paired_verdict`
============================================================================
The brief's own `paired_verdict` computed ``se = sd / sqrt(n)`` and then
``t = mean/se if se > 0 else 0.0``. For a PERFECT constant separation -- every delta
identical and non-zero -- ``sd`` is 0, so ``se`` is 0, so ``t`` collapses to 0 and the
verdict comes back NOT INTERPRETABLE. That is backwards: identical non-zero deltas across
many paired points are the STRONGEST possible signal, not the weakest. Measured directly:
``paired_verdict([1.0]*10, [2.0]*10)`` under the brief's own formula gives mean=-1.0,
sd=0.0, t=0.0, verdict NOT INTERPRETABLE -- and the brief's own
``test_a_clear_separation_is_reported`` cannot pass as written.

The fix adds an explicit zero-scatter guard:
  - sd == 0 and mean != 0  -> every paired point moved the same, non-zero amount. That is
    the perfect-separation case. Treated as significant: t is reported as ``inf`` (not
    fudged to some finite value above the threshold), and the verdict is decided by the
    sign of ``mean`` exactly as the normal branch does.
  - sd == 0 and mean == 0  -> the two series are IDENTICAL. That genuinely carries no
    information about which arm is better, and stays NOT INTERPRETABLE.

Do not "simplify" this guard away by going back to ``t = mean/se if se > 0 else 0.0``. That
version silently mis-scores every zero-scatter case as noise, and it already produced one
wrong verdict in this repo (``scripts/compare_runs.py``, same day this file was written) on
a real paired result before it was caught.

    """Same as `generate_batched`, but takes PRE-TOKENIZED prompt id lists rather than
    strings.

    REQUIRED whenever a forced prompt is built by concatenating two pieces that were each
    tokenized SEPARATELY -- exactly how scripts/derive_traces.py's
    `_sft_example_unaligned` builds every training example:

        p_ids = tok.encode(prompt)
        c_ids = tok.encode(completion, add_special_tokens=False)
        input_ids = p_ids + c_ids

    Tokenizing the JOINED RAW STRING instead (``tok(prefix + think_block)``) re-merges the
    boundary through the tokenizer's BPE and can silently produce a DIFFERENT token at the
    seam than training ever saw: training's boundary token before ``<think>`` is ``Ġ<``
    (id 19691, glued to the preceding space, seen 18,791 times at that exact position),
    but re-tokenizing the joined string instead produces a bare ``<`` (id 31, never seen
    there) -- an out-of-distribution seam at exactly the point being forced. Found in code
    review; see task-6-report.md's FINDING 1 addendum for the verified before/after
    numbers. Concatenating separately-encoded id lists (this function) is the only way to
    reproduce training's tokenization exactly -- a decode/re-encode round trip through text
    would reintroduce the same class of bug.
