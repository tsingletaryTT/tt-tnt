    THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. ``_emit`` used to size its emission with a flat

    availability. Real tokens/word across these nine sources runs 1.194 (tinystories) to
    1.559 (wikipedia_simple) -- a 30% spread -- so the emitter over-emitted for eight of
    the nine, by exactly the factor ``real_ratio / 1.3``. Consequences in the shipped
    blend: ``wikipedia_simple`` declared ``upsample=1`` and made 1.058 passes, silently
    duplicating ~5.8% of Simple Wikipedia; ``procedural`` made 4.03 passes, over the 4x
    working limit that Task 6 moved a whole share point to stay under; the blend totalled
    425,024,350 real tokens against a 400M budget; and the manifest reported every
    ``achieved_share`` as exactly its target to 15 decimal places.

    The ratio is derived rather than declared: ``available_tokens`` comes from
    ``docs/measurements/corpus_availability.json``, which is the trained tokenizer's own
    count over this same file, and dividing it by the file's word count gives that source's
    real tokens per word. ``target_words = want_tokens / ratio`` then makes the REAL
    emitted token count track the plan.

    With the ratio correct, a source's repetition factor collapses to
    ``want_tokens / available_tokens``, which ``plan_blend``'s gate already holds at or
    below the declared ``upsample`` -- so the emitter can no longer exceed a source's

    not a shared constant: a flat constant over-emits for every source that compresses
    worse than the constant claims, which is how an ``upsample=1`` source ends up
    duplicating part of itself.

    The final pass is TRUNCATED. An earlier draft of this function wrote
    only whole passes over the source file, which cannot undershoot a large source: with
    tinystories offering 445M tokens against a 120M want, one pass emitted the entire file
    and the slice achieved 53% against a 30% target, with the blend totalling 839M tokens
    against a 400M budget. Truncation is what makes the achieved shares track the targets.

    Streams line by line rather than reading the file into memory: tinystories.txt is ~1.9 GB
    and ``text.split()`` over it would build a list of hundreds of millions of str objects.

    Truncation is at WORD level, not line level: a source whose paragraphs are single long
    lines cannot be trimmed at a line boundary, so overshoot would be bounded by the longest
    line rather than by a couple of percent.

    ``on_text`` receives every string written, so a ``TokenMeter`` can count the real
    tokens of exactly this emission without a second pass over the output.

    THE TRUNCATED TAIL IS CLOSED WITH A ``DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR``. Word-level truncation lands
    wherever the token target lands, which is almost always in the middle of some document.
    Leaving that fragment unterminated would put an unmarked document transition at each of
    the nine source seams -- source A's half-sentence running straight into source B's first
    document -- which is precisely the failure this project is fixing everywhere else.
    Nine separators against ~400M tokens costs nothing; nine unmarked transitions is the
    exact shape of the bug. The separator is only added when the tail does not already end
    with one (a truncation can land exactly on a separator line), so it is never doubled,
    and the word it adds is counted in ``Emission.words`` -- ``emitted_words`` is what
    ``train/tokenization.py``'s stratified split uses to find each source's boundary in the
    finished corpus, so it must be the number of words actually written, not the number
    aimed at.

    The truncation, streaming, word-level-boundary and measured-ratio behaviour described
    above is covered by ``tests/test_blend_corpus.py``.
