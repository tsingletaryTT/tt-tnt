# Serving tt-tnt with tt-model and the Tenstorrent vLLM plugin

The headline of this project is that the model is packaged with
[tt-kernel](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-kernel-package-manager) and served through the
Tenstorrent vLLM plugin. This file is the procedure: what the bundle is, the commands that
actually brought a server up, and the traps that cost hours to find.

It is a **how-to**. [`tt-kernel-conformance.md`](tt-kernel-conformance.md) is the neighbouring
*findings report* — what a v4 manifest can express, which fields are read and which are
silently ignored — and it is the right file for "is tt-model's schema doing what it says".
This one assumes you want a server. Where the two overlap, this file states the operational
consequence and links there for the analysis.

Everything below was run on the box this model was developed on: a TT-QuietBox 2, four
Blackhole chips on two dual-chip p300c cards, serving on **one** of them. Paths under
`/home/ttuser/` are that box's; the rule each one illustrates is not.

> **Read [§7](#7-known-limitation-on-device-generation-is-degenerate) before you serve this
> for generation.** The packaging path works and the server answers. The *output* on device
> is worse than the same weights produce on CPU, and the cause is not known.

## 1. What the bundle is

Two artifacts, and nothing else:

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`manifests/tt_kernel_manifest-384.json`](../manifests/tt_kernel_manifest-384.json) | The v4 manifest — what tt-kernel renders into a launch command |
| [`bundle/tt_tnt_adapter.py`](../bundle/tt_tnt_adapter.py) | The `main_class` the plugin imports, carrying two runtime patches and one precision default |

`tt-model push` renders the manifest into a `vllm_metadata.json` and lays it beside the
adapter in the bundle folder. That rendered file is what `tt-model serve` actually reads:

```json
{
  "arch": "LlamaForCausalLM",
  "main_class": "tt_tnt_adapter:LlamaForCausalLM",
  "hf_weights": "episod/tt-tnt",
  "launch": {
    "default": {
      "command": ["python3", "server_example_tt.py", "--model", "episod/tt-tnt",
                  "--max_model_len", "2048", "--max_num_seqs", "8"],
      "env": {"VLLM_USE_V1": "1", "MESH_DEVICE": "P150", "HF_MODEL": "episod/tt-tnt"}
    }
  }
}
```

### 1.1 The manifest fields that matter

Of the 13 fields our manifest sets, four decide whether the server comes up and what it
serves.

`entrypoint.class` — `"tt_tnt_adapter:LlamaForCausalLM"`

`module:Class`, resolved *inside the bundle folder*. This is the field that makes the whole
"a model carries its own runtime change" property work: the plugin imports our module out of
`EXTRA_MODELS_DIR`, our module patches tt-metal at import time, and the patches are in place
before any `ModelArgs` is constructed. Confirmed in the serving log as
`platform.py:499 Registered TT model TTLlamaForCausalLM -> tt_tnt_adapter:LlamaForCausalLM
(from EXTRA_MODELS_DIR/episod__tt-tnt)`. `entrypoint.arch_name` (`LlamaForCausalLM`) is the
architecture the class registers under.

`mesh` — `{"devices": 1, "topology": "1x1"}`

`mesh.devices` reaches `device_count` in the published bundle's metadata, so search and any
consumer reasoning about topology see it. It does **not** reach the launch command: the mesh
the plugin actually opens comes only from `env.MESH_DEVICE`. `mesh.topology` has no consumer
at all. Those are two independent channels describing the same thing, and nothing
cross-checks them — see conformance findings [1 and 3](tt-kernel-conformance.md#findings).
Keep them consistent by hand; `tests/test_manifests.py` is our own gate on it.

`resources.max_model_len` — `2048`

Composed into the launch command as `--max_model_len` and reported on the wire at
`/v1/models`. Two constraints, both learned the hard way:

- It must be a **power of two**. `capped_warmup_seq_len`
  (`model_config.py:1150-1152`) requires it; a non-power-of-two hard-fails at startup with an
  unrelated-looking message.
- It must match **what the published weights were actually trained to**, which is not
  necessarily what the size registry currently targets. Declaring 512 against a 2048-context
  model does not error — it silently discards three quarters of the trained context.
  `tests/test_manifests.py::_PUBLISHED_CONTEXT` is the gate, and it distinguishes a published
  fact from a placeholder.

`resources.max_num_seqs` (8) is the concurrent-sequence cap and is composed the same way.

`env` — `{"VLLM_USE_V1", "MESH_DEVICE", "HF_MODEL"}`

- `MESH_DEVICE: "P150"` is a **lookup key for a mesh grid shape, not a board type**, and the
  name is a red herring on a box with no P150 in it. The plugin's
  `_MESH_GRID_PRESETS` (`vllm_tt_plugin/utils/dp_discovery.py`) maps `P150 -> (1, 1)`; nothing
  on the vLLM serving path attaches board semantics to the string. `(1, 1)` is the *only*
  shape this model can serve at: `num_key_value_heads: 3`, and `model_config.py:687-691`
  asserts both `n_heads` (6) and `n_kv_heads` (3) divide the mesh width, which admits widths
  {1, 3} — and no preset offers 3.
- `HF_MODEL` is **required and undocumented**. tt-kernel composes `--model <repo>` from
  `weights.repo`, but `tt_transformers` reads the model id from the `HF_MODEL` environment
  variable and raises `ValueError: Please set HF_MODEL to a HuggingFace name ...` if it is
  unset. Every v4 vLLM bundle needs it duplicated into `manifest.env`, and nothing validates
  that you did (conformance finding 2).

The remaining fields are compatibility and catalog metadata: `platform.ttnn` (`>=0.65,<0.80`)
is the real compatibility declaration and is what instance selection resolves against;
`runtime.kind: "vllm"`; `target: "p150"` is the machine key the launch entry is selected by;
`weights.repo`; `name` and `description`.

### 1.2 The two runtime patches the model depends on

`bundle/tt_tnt_adapter.py` adds **no model code** — tt-tnt is a standard HF Llama and the
stock `models.tt_transformers.tt.generator_vllm:LlamaForCausalLM` computes it. What the
adapter carries is what tt-metal gets wrong or defaults badly for a model this small. Both
patches describe themselves in-file as *shims, not fixes*, each with the upstream change that
would make it a deletable no-op.

**Patch 1 — `ModelArgs.find_grid`, for a harvested grid. Without it the model does not run
at all.** Upstream picks a core grid from hardcoded per-architecture constants
(`max_cols = 8 if is_wormhole_b0() else 12`) and never asks the device how large its compute
grid actually is. A harvested Blackhole has fewer usable columns than the architectural
maximum — the p300c this was developed on reports **11×10, not 12×10** — so for
`hidden_size=384` (12 tiles) `find_grid` returns a 12-column program config and RMSNorm fails
at the first decoder layer with `TT_FATAL shard_spec_validation.cpp:34 ... program_config grid
(12x1) must be contained within device grid (11x10)`. Given the *real* width the same
unmodified search finds `rows=2, cols=6`, which fits. The patch changes only where
`max_rows`/`max_cols` come from, falls back to the original implementation whenever the device
cannot be queried, and is idempotent and reversible (`restore_patches()`).

*To delete it:* upstream `find_grid` should read `compute_with_storage_grid_size()` rather
than hardcoding per-arch constants. Once that is in a released tt-metal, `_patch_find_grid`
becomes a no-op — remove it and raise the `platform.ttnn` floor in the manifest to the first
release that carries the fix, since the floor is what currently pins this bundle below it.

**Patch 2 — `ModelArgs.weight_cache_path`, fingerprinting the converted-weight cache.
Without it a republished model can be served as the previous one.** `tt_transformers`
converts HF weights to `.tensorbin` once and reuses them forever, keyed on the HF repo id and
nothing else (`model_config.py:577`), and the reuse decision (`ttnn/ttnn/operations/core.py:719`)
is a bare *existence* check — no revision, no content hash, no comparison against the source.
The patch appends one directory component derived from the source weights:

```
model_cache/episod/tt-tnt/P150/tensor_cache_bfp8/src-rev-a3c85ec799fe/...
```

The fingerprint is the HF commit sha (`hf_config._commit_hash`) where there is one; a sha256
over `(name, size, mtime_ns)` of `config.json` and every weight file for a local checkpoint
directory; and otherwise nothing, in which case the path is left exactly as stock **and a
warning says the guard is not in place**. `TT_TNT_CACHE_FINGERPRINT=0` turns it off (also
loudly). See [§4.6](#46-a-converted-weight-cache-keyed-on-the-repo-id-serves-the-previous-model)
for the incident this exists to prevent and what its log lines mean.

*To delete it:* the cache key at `model_config.py:577` should include the resolved revision.
Once that lands, `_patch_weight_cache_path` becomes a no-op and can go.

And one default, not a patch. The adapter subclasses the stock class solely to default
`optimizations` to `"accuracy"` rather than `"performance"`. The stock default serves MLP
`w1`/`w3` at BFLOAT4_B, which is tuned for 8B–70B models; this one is 384-wide and 22M
parameters. Measured over six prompts × 40 greedy tokens against the CPU reference, it is
worth about one token of agreement (median 4/40 against 3/40) — real, reproducible, and
not a remedy for §7. Overridable via `TT_TNT_OPTIMIZATIONS`.

The adapter also narrows the stock class's blanket-`True` capability flags to all-`False`
(`supports_prefix_caching`, `supports_async_decode`, `supports_sample_on_device`), because
none of them has been proven for this model. The plugin logs that async scheduling was
requested and **disabled**; that is the flags working, not a fault. Re-enable individually,
with evidence, via `TT_TNT_CAPS`.

---

## 2. The environment that can serve it

`tt-model serve` launches the bundle under a registered **tt-metal instance**. On this box:

```bash
tt-model instances list
```

```
[active] active: ttnn=0.65.1rc17.dev6200 vllm=— plugin=—  (/home/ttuser/.tenstorrent-venv/bin/python3)
[registry] metal-0.75-vllm: ttnn=0.75.0 vllm=0.24.0+empty plugin=0.1.0  (/home/ttuser/venv-vllm-latestmetal/bin/python3)
[registry] metal-src-vllm: ttnn=0.65.1rc17.dev6200 vllm=0.24.0+empty plugin=0.1.0  (/home/ttuser/venv-vllm-standalone/bin/python3)
```

`metal-src-vllm` is the one that works — a venv against the tt-metal *source tree* at
`/home/ttuser/tt-metal`. `metal-0.75-vllm` looks newer and better and cannot serve at all;
[§4.3](#43-the-0750-wheel-cannot-serve-on-this-box-sfpi-7610-against-a-pinned-7670) is why.

One registration detail worth knowing before you add your own: `all_instances()` dedupes by
`(os.path.realpath(python), tt_metal_home)`, and `realpath()` of a venv's `bin/python3`
resolves to the **base interpreter** — under `uv`, every venv on this box resolves to the same
`cpython-3.12.12` binary. Two venvs sharing a base interpreter *and* a `TT_METAL_HOME`
therefore collapse to one entry and the loser is dropped silently, with `instances add`
reporting success and `instances list` then not showing it. `metal-src-vllm` is registered
with its `--tt-metal-home` pointing at a **symlink** to `/home/ttuser/tt-metal` so that its key
differs from `active`'s. If that symlink ever disappears the instance breaks; a durable
symlink in a stable location is the better home for it.

---

## 3. Pull and serve

One command, from the right directory (see [§4.1](#41-the-launch-command-is-cwd-dependent)):

```bash
cd /home/ttuser/vllm-tt-plugin-standalone/examples
tt-model serve episod/tt-tnt --force --instance metal-src-vllm
```

`serve` pulls the bundle folder if it is absent, points `EXTRA_MODELS_DIR` at it, and launches
the OpenAI-compatible server with the bundle's launch command. **Repeat invocations skip the
pull** — which is a trap, not a convenience; see [§4.5](#45-tt-kernel-serve-prefers-the-cached-bundle-to-the-hub).

`--force` is needed on **every** invocation, not just the first. `serve` correctly selects
`metal-src-vllm` and prints its versions, and then the compatibility gate reads the *active*
environment rather than the selected instance and refuses to install, citing a ttnn and a
missing plugin that are not what would run. Both warnings below are that gate misreading the
environment; they are expected here and are not about the instance being launched:

```
! tt-metal: version 0.65.1rc17.dev6200 is older than required 0.72.0 — upgrade
! vllm: vllm present but the TT plugin (vllm_tt_plugin) is not importable — ...
```

Nothing about that is good — it trains the operator to ignore the flag that exists to surface
real problems — but it is where things stand.

Before you launch, print what will launch. `--print` composes the exact env and command
and returns without opening a device or a server:

```bash
tt-model serve episod/tt-tnt --print --local-only --instance metal-src-vllm
```

```
[vLLM: LlamaForCausalLM via default; instance=metal-src-vllm; EXTRA_MODELS_DIR=/home/ttuser/.cache/tt-kernel/bundles]
  OpenAI endpoint (once up): http://localhost:8000
TT_METAL_HOME=<tt-metal source tree> PYTHONPATH=<same> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<same>/build/lib \
EXTRA_MODELS_DIR=/home/ttuser/.cache/tt-kernel/bundles VLLM_USE_V1=1 MESH_DEVICE=P150 \
HF_MODEL=episod/tt-tnt /home/ttuser/venv-vllm-standalone/bin/python3 server_example_tt.py \
  --model episod/tt-tnt --max_model_len 2048 --max_num_seqs 8
```

Read `--max_model_len` in that output before every serve you intend to measure. It is the
cheapest check in this document and it catches [§4.5](#45-tt-kernel-serve-prefers-the-cached-bundle-to-the-hub)
outright.

---

## 4. The traps

Every one of these was found by hitting it. None of them announces itself.

### 4.1 The launch command is cwd-dependent

The rendered launch command names `server_example_tt.py` by **bare relative path**, so
`tt-model serve` only works from a directory that happens to contain the plugin's example
script. Run it from the model repo and it dies with

```
can't open file '/home/ttuser/code/tt-tnt/server_example_tt.py'
```

— an error naming *your* cwd, with nothing pointing at the bundle. Nothing documents the
requirement and nothing checks it. Serve from the plugin's `examples/` directory.

There is a second consequence that is easier to miss. `tt_transformers` builds its cache path
as a **relative** `model_cache/<repo id>/<MESH_DEVICE>/...`, so the converted-weight cache
lands under whatever directory you launched from. On this box that is
`/home/ttuser/vllm-tt-plugin-standalone/examples/model_cache/episod/tt-tnt/P150/`. Serving the
same model from two different directories gives you two different caches, and the one you
inspect may not be the one that was used.

### 4.2 `TT_VISIBLE_DEVICES` must not be exported

For single-device serving, leave `TT_VISIBLE_DEVICES` **unset**. The lease tooling actively
encourages exporting it with every chip you hold; doing that breaks this serve in two
different ways, and neither error names the variable:

```
TT_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<4 chips>  ->  mesh grid (1, 4)  ->  AssertionError: n_heads must be
                                                        divisible by num_devices: 6 % 4
TT_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<1 chip>   ->  TT_FATAL tt_cluster.cpp:281
                                  is_custom_fabric_mesh_graph_desc_path_specified()
```

The mechanism is `_resolve_mesh_grid` (`vllm_tt_plugin/worker.py:110-134`): `MESH_DEVICE=P150`
resolves to `(1, 1)`, but **a non-empty `TT_VISIBLE_DEVICES` overrides it** to
`(1, visible_count)`. Four visible chips therefore demand a 4-way tensor split of 6 heads and
3 KV groups. Exposing exactly one chip avoids that and breaks auto-discovery instead, because
a p300c board is two linked chips and splitting one off needs a custom mesh-graph descriptor.

With the variable unset, a p300c auto-discovers as `(1, 1)` — confirmed in the log as
`worker.py:840 Attempting to open mesh device with grid shape (1, 1)` — while UMD still opens
all four chips at cluster level (`Opening local chip ids/PCIe ids: {0, 1, 2, 3}`). If you are
holding a lease, that is still inside it; but note that it is a cluster-level open, so do not
run this alongside another tenant on the same box.

### 4.3 The 0.75.0 wheel cannot serve on this box: sfpi 7.61.0 against a pinned 7.67.0

`venv-vllm-latestmetal` carries ttnn **0.75.0** and looks like the obvious environment to
serve from. It cannot JIT its own dispatch kernels here. The host's
`/opt/tenstorrent/sfpi` is **7.61.0** (its own `README.md` says so) while that wheel's
`ttnn/tt_metal/sfpi-version` requires **7.67.0**, so every kernel compile fails with

```
'clamp' is not a member of 'sfpi'      (likewise 'min', 'max')
```

and the engine dies at `TT_THROW ... program.cpp:232`. Nothing in that message mentions sfpi
versions.

Serve from the **tt-metal source tree** instead. `/home/ttuser/tt-metal` ships its own
matching `runtime/sfpi` — 7.66.0 per `runtime/sfpi-version.cmake` — and compiles cleanly. That
is what the `metal-src-vllm` instance points at, and it is the environment every successful
serve recorded here used.

This is not a tt-tnt problem and its real fix is elsewhere: upgrade `/opt/tenstorrent/sfpi` to
7.67.0. Until then the newest wheel is unusable on this host.

### 4.4 `tt-model push` can change repository visibility as a side effect

On tt-kernel `main`, `--private/--public` is a plain boolean defaulting to `False`, and
`hub.set_visibility(repo_id, private=private)` runs on **every** push — not only when the repo
is created (`cli.py:275-277` on the dispatch path, `cli.py:497-499` on the vLLM path). So a
push with no visibility argument does not mean "leave it alone"; it **asserts public**. A push
with `--private` against a public repo asserts private. There is no confirmation and no diff.

This is fixed in [PR #12](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-kernel-package-manager/pull/12),
which makes the flag tri-state so an unset value leaves an existing repo's visibility alone.
Until that lands, be explicit and verify on both sides. Both of this project's Hub repos —
[`episod/tt-tnt`](https://huggingface.co/episod/tt-tnt) and
[`episod/tt-tnt-corpus`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/episod/tt-tnt-corpus) — are public and
must stay public, so every push here passes `--public`:

```bash
tt-model push episod/tt-tnt --public --backend vllm \
  --manifest manifests/tt_kernel_manifest-384.json \
  --bundle-dir <clean staging copy of bundle/> \
  --tt-metal-version 0.65.1 --arch blackhole
```

`python scripts/publish_to_hub.py --verify` checks the published repo's visibility against
`EXPECTED_PRIVATE = False` among its other round-trip checks; run it before and after.

Two smaller notes on `push` in the same area. `--tt-metal-version` should name the ttnn the
bundle was genuinely packaged and served against (`0.65.1` here), not the newest one
available; the manifest's `platform.ttnn` range is the real compatibility declaration.
And push from a **clean staging copy** of `bundle/` — the bundle-dir index on tt-kernel `main`
has no exclusion list, so an early push shipped
`vllm_bundle/__pycache__/tt_tnt_adapter.cpython-312.pyc`: stale bytecode published as part of a
model bundle. `bundle/__pycache__/` exists in this repo right now, so this is not hypothetical.
An exclusion list exists on an unmerged tt-kernel branch; until it lands, stage by hand.

### 4.5 `tt-model serve` prefers the cached bundle to the Hub

`serve` documents that "repeat invocations skip the pull and go straight to launch". The
consequence is not documented: **a manifest fix pushed to the Hub does not reach a machine that
already has the bundle.** `_ensure_vllm_pulled` returns the recorded local entry whenever its
`bundle_path` is a directory, before any Hub lookup, and `--force` does not change that —
`--force` only relaxes compatibility gating *if* a pull happens. Filed as
[issue #13](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-kernel-package-manager/issues/13).

It has already nearly produced a wrong measurement here. After the model was retrained and
republished at a 2048 context, `~/.cache/tt-kernel/bundles/episod__tt-tnt/vllm_metadata.json`
still held the **512** launch command from the previous push, so the server would have launched
at `--max_model_len 512` while the Hub said 2048.

Detect it:

```bash
tt-model serve episod/tt-tnt --print --local-only --instance metal-src-vllm   # read --max_model_len
cat ~/.cache/tt-kernel/bundles/episod__tt-tnt/vllm_metadata.json               # compare to the manifest you pushed
md5sum ~/.cache/tt-kernel/bundles/episod__tt-tnt/tt_tnt_adapter.py <repo>/bundle/tt_tnt_adapter.py
```

That last line matters independently: the **adapter** in the cached bundle is the one that
runs, so a local copy can be newer or older than the Hub's. On this box the two md5s match.
The Hub bundle, as of the last recorded check, still carries the **pre-fingerprint** adapter:
the cache fix was verified here but distributing it needs another `push`, which has not been
done. If you pull this bundle fresh on another machine, check the adapter you got against this
repo's `bundle/tt_tnt_adapter.py` before trusting §4.6's guarantees.

Avoid it: `tt-model rm episod/tt-tnt` removes the installed bundle folder and its index
entry, so the next `serve` pulls again. (On the runs recorded here the folder was *moved
aside* rather than removed, which is the same effect and keeps the old copy for comparison —
worth preferring when you are in the middle of a measurement.)

### 4.6 A converted-weight cache keyed on the repo id serves the previous model

This is the one that nearly produced a confident false measurement, and it is the reason the
adapter carries patch 2.

The first serve after a retrain came up **clean**: the adapter registered, the mesh opened at
`(1, 1)`, `/v1/models` reported the correct `max_model_len: 2048` — and it was running the
previous model's weights. `tt_transformers` had converted those weights once, cached them
at `model_cache/episod/tt-tnt/P150/tensor_cache_bfp8/`, and the reuse decision is a bare
existence check on a path keyed by repo id. The republished weights hit the same path and the
cache won. The log line reads

```
Loaded cache for model_cache/episod/tt-tnt/P150/...
```

which is indistinguishable from an ordinary warm start. Nothing said "these are a different
revision's weights". It was caught only because a human noticed the cache directory's mtime
predated the publish. Had it not been, the headline finding of that session would have been a
confident **0% EOS termination** — because the previous model could not emit an end-of-document
token by construction — and it would have read as a real regression.

It does not fail. It lies.

#### What the adapter's log lines mean

With patch 2 installed, four lines carry the whole story. Two are the reassuring half and are
emitted at INFO — which is why the adapter's logger is named `vllm.<module>`: vLLM configures
only the `vllm` logger and leaves root at `WARNING`, so a bare `getLogger(__name__)` had every
INFO record dropped and only the warnings ever reached the terminal.

| Line | Level | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `scoped the tt_transformers weight cache by source fingerprint` | INFO | The guard is installed. Its **absence** is the thing to notice. |
| `reusing the converted-weight cache for episod/tt-tnt (rev a3c85ec799fe) at .../src-rev-a3c85ec799fe` | INFO | Legitimate warm start — same source revision as last time. |
| `the source weights for episod/tt-tnt changed -- no converted-weight cache for rev <sha12>. Converting fresh weights. Previously cached revisions ... are NOT being used` | WARNING | A republish was detected; these weights are being converted now. |
| `... holds un-fingerprinted .tensorbin files from before this guard was installed. They are no longer read (that is the fix) and nothing here deletes them` | WARNING | Pre-guard leftovers, now dead weight. Deleting them is your call. |

Two further warnings say the guard is *not* protecting you: one when no fingerprint could be
derived (falls back to the stock path), one when `TT_TNT_CACHE_FINGERPRINT=0`. Both are worth
treating as a stop condition if you are about to record a number.

#### What a stale cache looks like on disk

Without the guard: one flat `tensor_cache_bfp8/` full of `.tensorbin` files whose mtimes
predate the publish, and no way to tell which weights produced them. With it, `ls` answers the
question that cost an afternoon:

```
tensor_cache_bfp8/
  *.tensorbin                 59 files   <- pre-guard leftovers, no longer read
  src-rev-a3c85ec799fe/       59 files + tt_tnt_cache_source.json
  src-rev-745d708fca12/       59 files + tt_tnt_cache_source.json
  src-rev-9583e97d0f94/       59 files + tt_tnt_cache_source.json
```

```json
{
  "source": "episod/tt-tnt",
  "fingerprint_kind": "rev",
  "fingerprint": "745d708fca12",
  "written_by": "tt_tnt_adapter",
  "written_at": "2026-08-15T02:23:06.400997+00:00"
}
```

The fingerprint is the **repo revision, not the weight content**, so any commit to the repo —
a card fix, a bundle push — mints a new revision and costs a full re-conversion even when
`model.safetensors` is untouched. That is the deliberate trade: false misses cost minutes,
false hits cost a wrong published measurement. At 22M parameters a re-conversion is under a
second; on a 70B model, fixing a README would not be. Old revision directories are retained,
not reclaimed — delete them by hand.

## 5. Verify it actually works

### 5.1 The server answers

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/models

`/v1/models` must report the `max_model_len` your manifest declares — that is the manifest
live on the wire, and it is the check that the bundle you served is the bundle you pushed.

### 5.2 The log lines worth reading

Four, in order of appearance:

- `platform.py:499 Registered TT model TTLlamaForCausalLM -> tt_tnt_adapter:LlamaForCausalLM
  (from EXTRA_MODELS_DIR/episod__tt-tnt)` — the bundle's adapter, not a built-in, is in play.
- `worker.py:840 Attempting to open mesh device with grid shape (1, 1)` — [§4.2](#42-tt_visible_devices-must-not-be-exported)
  did not bite.
- the adapter's cache lines — [§4.6](#46-a-converted-weight-cache-keyed-on-the-repo-id-serves-the-previous-model).
- `tt-tnt: using optimizations='accuracy'` and MLP weights appearing as `BFLOAT8_B` in the
  tensor-cache names (`feed_forward.w1_sharded_dtype_BFLOAT8_B`) — the precision default took
  effect. For contrast the KV cache allocates at `BFLOAT16`
  (`empty_kcache_paged_attention(2056, 3, 64, 64)_t0_dtype_BFLOAT16_layout_TILE`), which is the
  highest precision the stack offers.

You should also see async scheduling requested and **disabled**, and prefix caching disabled.
That is the adapter's capability flags doing their job.

### 5.3 That you are serving the weights you think you are

Three independent checks, cheapest first:

1. **The fingerprint in the log names a revision.** Compare that `sha12` against the Hub
   repo's current commit sha. If the log says `reusing` and the sha is not the one you just
   published, you are serving the previous model.
2. **The cache directory on disk.** `ls model_cache/<repo id>/<MESH_DEVICE>/tensor_cache_bfp8/`
   should hold a `src-rev-<sha12>/` for the revision you expect, with a
   `tt_tnt_cache_source.json` saying so. Remember the cache is relative to the cwd you served
   from ([§4.1](#41-the-launch-command-is-cwd-dependent)).
3. **A CPU cross-check that refuses to run on a mismatch.**

   ```bash
   python scripts/free_running_check.py --tokens 40
   ```

   It defaults its CPU reference to `artifacts/hf-tt-tnt-v3` — the artifact
   `scripts/publish_to_hub.py` uploads — and `_check_reference_matches_server()` compares that
   reference's `max_position_embeddings` against the served model's `max_model_len` from
   `/v1/models`, **exiting 3** when they disagree, however `--hf-dir` was chosen. This is what
   it printed the day it was first pointed at the wrong reference, when the served context was
   still 512:

   ```
   ERROR: CPU reference artifacts/384/hf has max_position_embeddings=256 but the server
   serves 'episod/tt-tnt' at max_model_len=512. These are different models, so a
   token-by-token comparison measures the difference between them, not the decode path.
   ```

   It is coarse — it cannot tell two models of equal context apart — but it catches the
   failure that actually happened, and it caught it again on the very next publish.
   `--allow-reference-mismatch` keeps deliberate cross-model comparison possible.

Checks 1 and 2 are the ones that answer "which weights", and they only exist because of
patch 2. On stock tt-metal there is no answer to that question in the server's output at all.

## 6. Republishing: the order that works

Two of the traps above only fire on a republish, so the sequence matters. This is the one that
was run:

```bash
python scripts/publish_to_hub.py --dry-run     # pre-flight guard, incl. the context length
python scripts/publish_to_hub.py --yes         # weights + card
tt-model push episod/tt-tnt --public --backend vllm \
  --manifest manifests/tt_kernel_manifest-384.json \
  --bundle-dir <clean staging copy of bundle/> \
  --tt-metal-version 0.65.1 --arch blackhole
python scripts/publish_to_hub.py --restore-card --yes
python scripts/publish_to_hub.py --verify
```

`--restore-card` is not optional and it is not a nicety. `tt-kernel`'s `tag_repo`
(`hub.py:56-66`) replaces the model card's front matter wholesale with
`ModelCardData(tags=...)` on **every** push, discarding `license`, `library_name`,
`pipeline_tag`, `datasets` and `base_model`. The prose body survives; the metadata does not.
Observed both times: all four were `None` after the push and all four were back after the
restore. [`docs/model-card.md`](model-card.md) is the source of truth that gets re-applied.

Then, before serving the new revision: clear or move aside the cached bundle
([§4.5](#45-tt-kernel-serve-prefers-the-cached-bundle-to-the-hub)) and expect the adapter to
announce a fresh conversion ([§4.6](#46-a-converted-weight-cache-keyed-on-the-repo-id-serves-the-previous-model)).
If the first serve after a republish says `reusing`, stop and find out why.

## 7. Known limitation: on-device generation is degenerate

The packaging path works. The generation does not. Anyone serving this model for
generation should know this before they start, and nothing above should be read as "the model
serves correctly" — only that the *packaging* path works.

The same weights, served through the plugin on a Blackhole chip, produce worse output than
they produce on CPU **at identical settings**. Greedy decoding collapses into repetition loops
where CPU produces coherent prose. Sampling (t = 0.8, top-p 0.95) removes the hard loops and
shows what is underneath: agrammatical run-ons with no clause boundaries, and malformed
non-words — *"Invisers"*, *"o'Splains"*, *"megathering"*, *"d'Bule"* — that appear nowhere in
the CPU output. Over the same 29 completions per side, the local-repeat rate is **0.161 on
device against 0.104 on CPU (1.55×)**; the metrics understate it, because they do not capture
grammaticality, which is where the gap is widest. The full output is recorded in
[`docs/measurements/samples-tt-tnt-v3-ondevice-t0.8.md`](measurements/samples-tt-tnt-v3-ondevice-t0.8.md).
The recorded verdict is *not usable*.

Two more angles on the same defect:

- **Free-running greedy agreement with CPU**, six prompts × 40 tokens: median **4/40**
  (min 0, max 5).
- **EOS termination** on the frozen 15-prompt set: **2/15 on device against 5/15 on CPU**
  greedy, 7/30 against 11/30 sampled. A path that degenerates into repetition is a path that
  does not reach a natural ending.

Prefill is sound. Across both prompt sets, 20 of 21 prompts agree with CPU on the *first*
generated token — the one that comes purely out of prefill with no decode step. That localises
the fault to the decode / KV-cache path.

Nine hypotheses have been refuted and the cause is not known: the weights, the conversion,
the `find_grid` patch, MLP quantization, prefix caching, async decode, on-device sampling, the
KV-cache dtype (it is already `BFLOAT16`, the highest the stack offers), and the possibility
that the whole thing was an artifact of greedy decoding. The defect has also survived a change
of tokenizer, corpus, corpus revision, context length, weights and tt-metal build. The surface
still worth attacking is the paged-attention decode control path — page-table / slot-mapping
and position handling per decode step.

**New evidence, 2026-08-27, pointing at exactly that surface.** Serving a local (unpublished)
checkpoint directly through `server_example_tt.py` (not a Hub-registered bundle) hit a hard
crash — `AssertionError: Sequence length 1024 exceeds max seq len 512` in
`models/tt_transformers/tt/model.py:389`'s `prepare_inputs_prefill`, killing the whole
`EngineCore` process (`EngineDeadError`, not a per-request 400) — after a small, consistent
number of **independent, single-turn completion requests** (18 succeeded before the 19th
failed with `--max-num-batched-tokens 512` alone; still crashed, later, with
`--no-enable-prefix-caching` added too). Each request was a fresh, unrelated prompt with no
continuation between them — nothing about the workload should accumulate position across
requests. That it does anyway (crossing the 512 threshold after enough *unrelated* requests,
not enough tokens in *one* request — every individual prompt measured well under 200 tokens)
is consistent with `start_pos`/slot state carrying over between logically-independent
sequences rather than resetting per request, exactly the "position handling per decode step"
surface named above. Disabling prefix caching changed the failure count but did not fix it,
so prefix caching is not the (sole) mechanism. Not root-caused further — this was hit while
evaluating `tt-tnt-1024-editor` (`.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-27-editor-training/`), a training
task, not a serving-infra debugging task, and the ninth hypothesis above already spent real
effort on a closely related area. Recorded here as a new, reproducible data point for whoever
next attacks this surface, not as a new fix.

**A resilience wrapper, not a fix, 2026-08-28.** `scripts/serve_supervisor.py` accepts this
defect as a standing fact of serving through this stack rather than something to route
around per-invocation: it launches the same recipe as a subprocess in its own process group,
health-checks `/v1/models` and the process's own exit status every few seconds, and
transparently relaunches on either signal (a fresh gozer lease each time). Confirmed live: the
served engine crashed a second time, unattended, mid-session while this script was being
written — exactly the failure mode it exists to absorb. It kills the WHOLE process group on
relaunch, not just the top-level `gozer run` pid, because that alone was observed twice to
leave `server_example_tt.py`/`EngineCore` orphaned and the lease stuck `HELD-FOREIGN`. Every
restart is logged with a timestamp, so an operator can see how often this is actually firing
rather than watching an illusion of stability.

One thing to carry away if you are gating a serving path of your own: the `tt_transformers`
PCC check passed at **0.9940–0.9998** throughout, because it exercises prefill far harder than
long decode. **A green PCC is not evidence of correct generation.**

## 8. Serving `tt-tnt-1024` across all 4 chips

Verified working, 2026-08-27. This is `manifest.mesh.fabric` and `mesh.topology`'s decorative
status ([finding 1](tt-kernel-conformance.md#findings)) made concrete: **neither field is
consumed by the launch composition**, so getting this right is a manual recipe, not something
`tt-model serve` renders for you from the manifest alone. Two extra pieces beyond the normal
2-chip launch, on top of everything in §2–§3:

```bash
TT_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<all 4 chip BDFs> \
TT_MESH_GRAPH_DESC_PATH=train/configs/mesh/mesh-1x4-ring.textproto \
tt-model serve episod/tt-tnt-1024 --force --instance metal-src-vllm -- \
  --additional-config '{"tt":{"fabric_config":"FABRIC_2D_TORUS_XY"}}'
```

**Why a custom mesh graph descriptor at all.** tt-metal ships
`p300_x2_mesh_graph_descriptor.textproto` declaring the true physical wiring
(`device_topology { dims: [2, 2] }`), but vLLM's `MESH_DEVICE=P300x2` opens a `(1, 4)`
`MeshShape` — a mismatch this project already hit once during DDP training bring-up
(`.superpowers/ddp-bringup.md`): `device_topology.dims` must equal the `MeshShape` actually
opened, or the mismatch surfaces as either a hang (ttml) or a `Fabric Router Sync` timeout
(vLLM). `train/configs/mesh/mesh-1x4-ring.textproto` declares `dims: [1, 4] dim_types: [LINE,
RING]` — verified against the real Ethernet cabling via
`tt-metal/build_Release/tools/umd/topology` (chip0↔1↔2↔3↔0, a genuine 4-cycle, in exactly the
BDF order used for `TT_VISIBLE_DEVICES`) — so it's a faithful model, not a guess.

**Why `FABRIC_2D_TORUS_XY` and not `FABRIC_1D_RING`.** Read directly from tt-metal source
(`tt_metal/fabric/fabric_context.cpp:162-176`): `FABRIC_1D_RING` maps to `Topology::Ring`, and
`is_2D_topology()` (`fabric_edm_types.hpp:15`) only returns true for `Mesh`/`Torus` — so
`FABRIC_1D_RING` takes the *same* single-hop-only routing branch as plain `FABRIC_1D`
(`fabric.cpp:148-169`, the tracked `#22524` workaround loop, which does not model a ring's
wraparound edge at all). `FABRIC_2D_TORUS_XY` maps to `Topology::Torus`, which *is* 2D and
takes a structurally different, working routing path. Confirmed empirically, not just from
source: a properly-applied `FABRIC_1D_RING` (`--additional-config '{"tt":{"fabric_config":
"FABRIC_1D_RING"}}'` — note the required `"tt"` nesting, see below) still fails identically;
`FABRIC_2D_TORUS_XY` opens `multidevice with 4 devices and grid (1, 4)` cleanly.

**The `"tt"` nesting is not optional and fails silently without it.**
`vllm_tt_plugin/config.py:get_tt_config()` requires the JSON under a `"tt"` key —
`{"tt": {"fabric_config": "..."}}`, not `{"fabric_config": "..."}`. A flat object is treated as
absent and the fabric config silently falls back to the default (`FABRIC_1D` on this board),
with no warning. This cost a full round of (wrong) debugging before being caught.

**This is not baked into the manifest on purpose.** `select_launch` picks a launch entry by
detected machine SKU, not by how many chips happen to be visible at runtime — so anything added
to `resources.extra_args` would apply unconditionally to *every* serve on this machine,
including the already-deployed 2-chip config, at an untested fabric setting. Until 2-chip is
also verified under `FABRIC_2D_TORUS_XY` (it hasn't been), keep this as an explicit opt-in
command rather than the manifest default.

**Correctness regression, now confirmed by a controlled A/B — do not use this for anything
quality-sensitive yet.** The same prompt, same slot-style short-generation ask
(`scripts/story_tools.py`), same sampling settings, run back-to-back on 4-chip
(`FABRIC_2D_TORUS_XY`) and 2-chip (`MESH_DEVICE=P150`, `TT_VISIBLE_DEVICES` unset):

| | sample |
|---|---|
| 4-chip | `'Shepat, the intruder set themselves Tryburg and drive Jennie Griffin into the waitingress's's "‑TheButt.'` |
| 2-chip | `'Every day, she was a curious and she was always tried to discover a small, just for herself.'` |

2-chip is grammatically rough (consistent with this checkpoint's already-documented weakness),
but every candidate was recognizable English. 4-chip produced invented non-words
("Tryburg", "Alexandary", "Higheriq") across most candidates, in a pattern distinct from
ordinary repetition-collapse. This is a real quality regression specific to
`FABRIC_2D_TORUS_XY` on this config, not this checkpoint's ordinary ceiling — root cause
unknown (a numerical correctness issue in that fabric's collective ops is the leading
suspect, untested). Treat the mesh-open/generate success above as proof the *packaging* path
works, exactly the same caveat §7 makes for the original decode-defect story — not proof the
*output* is trustworthy.
